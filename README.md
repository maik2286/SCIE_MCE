## Introduction

Color plays a crucial role in design, branding, and visual communication. The SCIE_MCE tool leverages advanced algorithms to extract and analyze major colors from images. By using SWASA and S-CIELAB, this tool ensures accurate color representation and extraction, making it a valuable resource for anyone working with color data.

## Installation

To get started with SCIE_MCE, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maik2286/SCIE_MCE.git
   cd SCIE_MCE
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the latest release:**

   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/maik2286/SCIE_MCE/releases) to download the latest version. Once downloaded, execute the program as follows:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Using SCIE_MCE is straightforward. After installation, you can run the program and provide an image file for analysis. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Run the program:**

   ```bash
   python main.py path_to_your_image.jpg
   ```

2. **View results:**

   The tool will output the major colors detected in the image along with their corresponding values in the S-CIELAB color space.

## Features

- **Accurate Color Extraction:** Utilizes SWASA and S-CIELAB for precise color representation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
- **Visual Output:** Generates visual representations of the extracted colors.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## How It Works

SCIE_MCE employs two key components: SWASA and S-CIELAB.

### SWASA

SWASA (Spatially Weighted Average of Spatially Averaged Colors) is an algorithm designed to improve color extraction accuracy by considering spatial information. This approach allows for better detection of dominant colors in complex images.

### S-CIELAB

S-CIELAB is a color space that enhances the standard CIELAB by incorporating spatial and perceptual attributes. This color space is particularly effective for distinguishing between similar colors and providing a more accurate representation of human color perception.
